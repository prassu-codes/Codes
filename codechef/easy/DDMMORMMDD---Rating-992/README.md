## Problem

### DDMM or MMDD

Chef is confused by all the different formats dates can be written in. Here's a simple problem Chef wants you to solve.

You are given a date string $S$. The date follows the Gregorian calendar, the one used in most parts of the world.

Identify whether it is of the form `DD/MM/YYYY` or `MM/DD/YYYY`, or if it can be of both forms. Here `DD` denotes the 2-digit day, `MM` denotes the 2-digit month and `YYYY` denotes the 4-digit year.

It is guaranteed that $S$ is a valid date taking at least one of these forms.

For example,

- 21/05/2001 is of the form DD/MM/YYYY and not MM/DD/YYYY.
- 10/15/2069 is of the form MM/DD/YYYY and not DD/MM/YYYY.
- 05/11/1999 can be of both forms.
### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing a string of $10$ characters $S$ — the date string $S$, which is of the form DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY. It is guaranteed that $S$ is a valid date taking at least one of these forms.
### Output Format

For each test case, output "`BOTH`" if the date string satisfies both forms. Otherwise output "`DD/MM/YYYY`" if it is of the form `DD/MM/YYYY`, else "`MM/DD/YYYY`". Note that the output may be case-insensitive. So "`DD/MM/YYYY`", "`dd/mm/yyyy`" and so on will be considered the same.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 2023$
- $S$ is of the form DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
21/05/2001
10/15/2069
05/11/1999
29/02/2024

```

```
DD/MM/YYYY
MM/DD/YYYY
BOTH
DD/MM/YYYY

```

### Explanation:

Fun fact: `29/02/2024` (read as `DD/MM/YYYY`) is a leap year day.

```py
t=int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s=input()
    c=""
    d=""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i in [0,1]:
            c+=(s[i])
        if i in [3,4]:
            d+=(s[i])
    c=int(c)
    d=int(d)
    if c<=12 and d<=12:
        print("both")
    elif c>12:
        print("DD/MM/YYYY")
    else:
        print("MM/DD/YYYY")
        
```
