# Sqrt(x)

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return  *the square root of* `x` *rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be  **non-negative**  as well.

You  **must not use**  any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1

        r=x
        while l<=r:
            mid=(l+r)//2
            square=mid*mid
            if square==x:
                return mid
            elif square <x:
                l=mid+1 
            else:
                r=mid-1 
        return r
```
